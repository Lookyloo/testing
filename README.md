# Lookyloo testing

Lookyloo is building trees out of weird stuff happening on websites. This repository
is a simple webservice used to show in a relatively easy way what happen on web developement.

And it will be used in Lookyloo testsuite.

You can browse the examples on [heroku](https://lookyloo-testing.herokuapp.com/).
